# DefaultToAnisotropic
Fuck Bilinear. All my homies use Anisotropic.

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to be a fucking chad AND use Anisotropic filtering by default when you import StaticTexture2Ds. There is virtually no performance downside to this unless you're on mobile hardware (eww).

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [DefaultToAnisotropic.dll](https://github.com/Toxic-Cookie/DefaultToAnisotropic/releases) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
